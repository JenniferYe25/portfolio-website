        Potential clients often contact our firm with a work-related issue, only
        to discover that while there may not be a legal basis to pursue the
        matter, they have another claim they did not even know about. These
        claims typically turn out to be far more valuable to the worker and more
        feasible to go after. This scenario frequently occurs with regard to
        claims involving overtime pay and wage payment regulations. To that end,
        these are the ten things you need to know before pursuing legal action:

          These include straight time pay for overtime (rather than time and a
          half); day-rate pay with no overtime; misclassification of an employee
          as a 1099 worker or independent contractor; and misclassification of
          salaried employees as being exempt from overtime.

        You Can’t Sign Away Your Right to Overtime Pay

        <p>
          Overtime pay rights cannot be waived by signing a contract or agreeing
          to be paid straight time only or a flat day rate. If you are owed
          overtime pay, the laws in your state allow you to seek lost wages from
          your employer, regardless of prior agreements.

          Employers often give inaccurate information about overtime pay laws
          and aren’t looking out for your best interests. The overtime laws are
          complex. If you have not been paid time and a half after 40 hours, you

          Many states have enacted overtime laws that are more favorable to
